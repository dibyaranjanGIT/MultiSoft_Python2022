What is an Algorithm ?
Algorithms are the methods and techniques (It's a way of solving a particular problem) used to solve problems related to
data structures such as arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc. An algorithm takes input data and performs a series
of operations to transform it into the desired output.

Array : A collection of elements with similar data type

Array of integers = [101, 102, 102, 103]


Topics:
