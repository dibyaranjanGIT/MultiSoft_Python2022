Time Complexity

Array
a = [1,2,3,....100]

To get the element a[10], how many operations system has to perform to fetch that element.

sequential access
random access

linked list
head ->1 ->2 ->3 ->4 .....->100

Linear search
suppose you are searching for element 90, using linear search the best case scenario is to find the
element in the first place and the worst case scenario is to find the element in the last

we denote the worst case with bigO(n),when the data grows how the time grows


Binary search
when the array is sorted
the middle most element is 100/2=50
if you are searching 90 is 90


O(1) < O(log n) < O(n)  < O(nlogn) < O(n2) <O(n3) < O(2n) < O(n!)

lest time   ------------------------------------------ high time

Space Complexity
when we give some extra space (auxiliary space) then we can reduce the time taken.
