Q1.
Code to find an Armstrong number
371 is an armstrong numbre
3**3 + 7**3 + 1**3 = 371
153 is also an armstrong numbe
9474= (9x9x9x9)+ (4x4x4x4)+ (7x7x7x7)+ (4x4x4x4)


Q2.
Black Jack problem

user_cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
computer_cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]

In first user will get cards and computer will get two cards
Then you will ask user to draw one more card if yes then draw and add the value of it
repeat the above as long as user is ready to draw

once the user stops the computer will draw random cards until it reaches less than 21 and greater that users card
value
If the computer is less than the users value or it crosses the value of 21 then it looses

Hint1:
You have to use random module to pick cards from the list
random.choice(li)
