HTTP Methods
REST APIs listen for HTTP methods like GET, POST, and DELETE to know which operations to perform on the web serviceâ€™s
resources. A resource is any data available in the web service that can be accessed and manipulated with HTTP requests
to the REST API. The HTTP method tells the API which action to perform on the resource.

While there are many HTTP methods, the five methods listed below are the most commonly used with REST APIs:

HTTP method	Description
GET	Retrieve an existing resource.
POST	Create a new resource.
PUT	Update an existing resource.
PATCH	Partially update an existing resource.
DELETE	Delete a resource.
