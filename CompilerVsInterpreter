Interpreter :
    1.one statement at a time
    2.An interpreter is needed every time
    3.Partial execution if an error occurs in the program.
    4.Easy for programmers.

Compiler :
    1.Entire program at a time
    2.Once compiled, it is not needed
    3.No execution if an error occurs
    4.Usually not as easy as interpreted once

Extra Compiler:
    1.The code written in a compiled language must be given to a compiler and we get an executable whcih makes our code
    Private
    2.Faster execution , we compiled our code once and execute it multiple times.
    Disadvantage: the code which is compiled in the windows can't be run in the mac machine = hencne no portable

Extra Interpreter:
    Portable: here we are providing the source code to run in a different machine.
    Debugging: here debugging is easier than the compiler language.
    Disadvantge: Here to run the code in a different machine we need an interpreter to be install in each machine.
    Slower : Every time the translation happens for the code hence slower.
