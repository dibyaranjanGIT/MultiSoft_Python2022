Generating distributions

Distribution archives are needed for hosting it as a package. To generate these packages,
we need to install two additional packages.

pip install setuptools wheel

Now that we installed them, run the below command to generate archives:
python setup.py bdist_wheel

cd dist

pip install .\packagedibya-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
